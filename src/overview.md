# zKTT Docs

Welcome to the [zKTT](https://github.com/webisoftSoftware/zktt) docs page where all the more in-depth and technical aspects of the zKTT codebase will be discussed and explained for developers looking to use the [Dojo](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/sozo/world-commands/execute) framework to build or \
improve onchain contracts in the [Starknet](https://book.starkli.rs/installation) ecosystem. Essentially, the 'whys' and 'hows' for specific cairo and dojo syntax will be explored and you can expect anything ranging from developer notes, to advanced cairo topics and feature discussions to be included in this book.

This book assumes that you have prior knowledge of Blockchain, specifically for [Starknet](https://docs.starknet.io/), as well as some experience with its contract language - [Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch14-00-building-starknet-smart-contracts.html). If you don't know one of these topics or need a refresher, we suggest you take a look at these helpful resources to get up to speed before proceeding.
