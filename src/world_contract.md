# World Contract

### IWorldDispatcher

You probably have some questions regading this infamous **IWorldDispatcher** contract that we have been passing around in the dojo systems above. The **world contract** is a dojo-defined contract that defines the world in which the dojo contracts and models will reside in. It is just like any contract: it has its own interface, implementation and storage (which will be used throughout the lifetime of our project). As a result, just like any other starknet contract in Cairo, you can import it's **dispatcher** and **interface** (**IWorldDispatcher, IWorldDispatcherTrait**).&#x20;
